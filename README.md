**How To Do This Challenge**:
1. Create A Script That Extends A Scene.
2. Make An @onready lua-style dictionary (for loading in nodes, if thats what you want.) that will store all your code
3. remember to put a comma after every sentence
4. make a Callable inside it that will call the neccessary standard functions:
5. call that callable in _ready():
6. this is too hard to explain so just see the visual example file:
7. enjoy being a masochist nerd
